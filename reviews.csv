"Be careful","2022-10-16","4","Less is more with this product. When I first introduced myself to it, I used entirely too much. I made them too dark. But this was also when this product just came out. It's good and long lasting. Just be light handed"
"No Title","2019-02-10","5","One of my favorite concealers I prefer this over shape tape any day of the week. It doesn't cake at all and it looks so pretty under the eyes"
"No Title","2019-02-09","3","Not the worst drugstore concealer, not the best one though. Works beautifully for small blemishes and to correct certain spots, but if you have very strong dark circles does not work that well. It is also not that long lasting as I would like it to be."
"Easiest At Home Mani","2018-03-28","5","As a mom of 3 little kids with a full time job a manicure is a luxury. This 2 step process makes it easy and feasible since it lasts the full work week! I now have multiple colors and all look fantastic!"
"Very good product","2017-07-21","5","This polish actually provides great coverage. The color (Terra-Coppa) is a vibrant metallic that will look good with any outfit. The polish as well as the top coat applied very easily and evenly. The brush has more of a paint brush appearance that helped greatly with the application. The polish itself lasted a good week without chipping even though I was not particularly careful. Would definitely recommend this product."
"No Title","2020-04-01","2","This polish is not terrible but the brush, for me, is terrible. I have very small mail beds and the brush is large and flat and cumbersome. I'm not a fan of large polish brushes. It's difficult to do detail work with them and I feel they become gunky over time."
"Legit","2017-07-20","5","I love the color and it has stayed on very well throughout my motherly duties like changing sheets, grabbing  laundry out of the washer and dryer, scrubbing things and even using household cleaners without gloves on."
"All Out Pout Nude Lipstick","2018-08-07","4","Very nice and rich texture with a very Angelina Jolie nude color. Just a tad darker and pinker than my own medium olive Anglo skin, it’s a shade away from dead. I use a warmer longwearing lip liner and it adds enough color. I’m use to the very long wearing lip products so I can’t say it really lasts long but it’s on the matte side and so stays on for at least a few hours. Especially if your not eating or drinking."
"Nail Perfection","2017-07-16","5","This polish is so strong.  Most polishes just chip away.  I work a lot with my hands and have not had an issue with this polish chipping. I also tend to see chipping after showering but that also did not happen with this polish.  Definitely recommend.  The top coat seals the polish and gives is a beautiful smooth shiny look."
"Dip brow","2022-07-10","5","So smooth and glides so easy! With this i can do my eyebrows in a matter of seconds! I love this product and will always huy"
"No Title","2019-11-20","5","My favorite, it gives a nice look to my brows and is very easy to blend. Is very pigmented and waterproof. Love it I always use it."
"LOVE LOVE LOVE!!","2017-07-19","5","I've always had a hard time getting nail polish that won't chip off my nails because I have a very active lifestyle  with my kids and husband and can be a little rough on my nails. I love getting gel manicures at the salon but it's too much an expense and the process is too long for me to take time out of my day to do it.  The Sally Hansen Miracle Coat nail polish system was great because it was so easy and there was no fuss with any lights but I had the look and durability like I'd  gone to the salon.  I can't wait to pick out my next color and use it again!"
"The best one","2018-07-25","5","I’ve tried it and aleays use this one after that and always keep the same"
"Beautiful","2020-12-07","5","Perfect shades. Light non greasy. Perfect coverage. A must"
"Not ideal for older women","2018-07-25","3","Color was exactly as expected. Color lasts reasonably well. I found I didn't like the matte texture. I'm 51 and my lips aren't as plump as they were when I was in my 20s. This texture really amplifies the little lines and cracks, and makes my lips appear far older than they look without lipstick. Perhaps this lipstick would be fine on a young woman, but I do not recommend it for someone in their 50s who isn't using fillers and plumpers. Adding a lip balm underneath the lipstick helped a bit, but it also made the lipstick less long-wearing."
"Beautiful yet Practical","2017-11-03","5","The Sally Hansen Miracle Gel & Top coat goes on smoothly and evenly.  It dries quickly, so it doesn't hinder me from moving around for long periods of time.  The top coat adds an extra shine that makes the paint look fresh much longer and last longer.  I would highly recommend Sally Hansen Miracle Gel & Top Coat to anyone who wants beautiful nails but leads an active lifestyle."
"My nails look perfect immediately!","2017-07-27","5","I love how easy Sally Hansen Miracle Gel and Top Coat are to use. They go on smoothly and look great even only after one application.
The color is rich and vibrant and stays on longer then any other nail polish that I use.
The top coat adds more shine, and helps to set the polish perfectly! 
Sally Hansen Miracle Gel and Top Coat are now my favorites polishes to use :)"
"Glad I gave this a second chance...","2017-12-15","3","The first time I used the gel color and top coat, I did not allow the color to dry completely before applying the top coat. My nails smudged easily, even after letting it dry for a couple of hours and by the 5th day there was already a lot of chipping and peeling of the polish. The second time I used it I decided to make sure the color was completely dry before applying the top coat. I let the color dry for about an hour and then applied the top coat and let that dry for about an hour to an hour and fifteen minutes. The second use was a success. I had no smudging issues and the finished product still looked fresh by the end of the second week. I only had to small color chips on day 21 when I removed the color and I only had to remove the color due to nail growth. If you have the time to allow the coats to dry then I would definitely recommend this product."
"lousy applicator","2020-12-07","2","difficult to judge if you're getting enough or too much and then dries out - product itself is great"
"148 hazelnut Maybelline","2020-12-07","5","This products is excellent and love the package its great and also my skin color ."
"It's okay","2022-12-27","3","I wouldn't say this is my favorite too coat for 2 reasons: it's thick and it leaves a big separation on your nail. I feel like this polish gets chunky easily and when you put it on, it goes on thick as well. You can see the difference between the top coat and your color painted nail."
"The Best!!","2021-06-25","5","I love it, it's the best! My face perspires quite a bit, but this stays on and on. It's all I use!"
"Love the product but why no applicator inc?","2021-06-21","1","No applicator included even though there is a spot located below the product to put one like there always was in previous years?  That is crazy in my opinion!  I will switch to another product even though I used this for many years!"
"No Title","2020-01-30","3","I really like how strudy this makes my nails. This is the color ""Jealous Boyfriend"". The issue is how soft this formula is. It ends up peeling up and chipping after a few days. It makes my nails a bit sturdier but not by much. I wish it would harden up quicker and easier."
"No Title","2019-02-09","3","This concealer has a thin formula but is buildable. Goes on very smooth and is easily blendable. Id recommend this to those with fine lines because it settles nicely on the skin. I have found higher end concealers to perform better and are only slightly more expensive so I will not be purchasing again."
"Bright colour","2019-11-16","5","It’s awesome in colour, texture and smoothy."
"Miracle is right!","2019-09-23","5","I am obsessed with the miracle gel. especially the top coats.   I very frequently do my nails and the top coats keep any polish looking fresh for weeks.   I was so excited to see the matte top coat when it came out and use it a lot!  It's awesome"
"Long lasting pedi","2017-07-20","5","As soon as I got this product I tested it on my toes and it's still holding up! Hasn't chipped, looks shiny, love the color, and still lasting strong! Love that I don't need a light and can do this mani/pedi anytime, anywhere."
"Great color, long lasting!","2017-07-27","5","I like the soft color and the applicator brush, very easy to use.  The Miracle gel top coat is amazing, my polish has lasted so long!  I'm bring these products to my family gathering so that some of the women in my family can try it out too.  My mom-in-law is big into nail polish, I'm sure she'll love it!"
"Extremely Happy","2017-07-25","5","I've never used a two step polish before and it was great! Goes on super smoothly and dries very fast, doesn't get goopy or smudge as it dries. Very shiny, glittery and smooth on the nail. I've had the polish on for about two weeks and it hasn't chipped or come off. I was very surprised when it didn't chip off in the shower like normal polish tends to do. Very happy with this!"
"Pretty Good Product","2014-08-19","3","This is a good alternative to using gel polish with a led light. This product does not require that so its great! There is a great selection of colors and the polishes are relatively in the same price range as good quality polishes. Plus side of this product is it lasts about 4 or 5 days with no chips at all. Downside to this product is it is not as shiny as I would like after the top coat and it was a mess to remove, the polish smeared all over my skin with nail polish remover. All in all this is a product I would use again and would purchase. I received my polish for review purposes on Influenster."
"No Title","2019-02-09","4","I love a good highlighting concealer even more a great brand like maybelline. I got hooked a few months ago after trying a few products and now it's no looking back the age rewind concealer knocks 10 years off your wrinkles and has you looking as fresh as a daisy tell me who doesn't like that!"
"Disappointed","2020-04-11","2","My girlfriend was quite disappointed when she opened the lipstick to realize that the rosewood colour advertised was not matching the product received. The online picture showed a more rose/pink version of the lipstick, as the lipstick itself had a darker and more orange shade to it. Once applied, she felt it did not look good on her skin tone. She would have loved this lipstick if it would have been in a more rose/pink shade as advertised. The texture of the lipstick was indeed very rich and the fragrance was a bit strong. Disappointing"
"Llong lasting and chip resistant!","2017-08-24","5","Sally Hanson Miracle Gel & Top Coat is a great product! It's vibrant, long lasting, and does not chip easily. I would recommend it to anyone who is tired of having to reapply/redo their polish often."
"Lighest Shade too dark","2016-12-22","3","I really liked the coverage this concealer gave, but it did not brighten my under-eyes because it is too dark for me."
"3rd time","2016-12-21","1","3rd time trying to leave a review, apparently is not meeting the guidelines, which i dont get, i am not saying anything offensive. Heres my review: The shades are too Light and Pink, no options for medium or darker tones."
"Long Lasting Beauty","2017-08-26","4","I really enjoyed the color. The application took a couple coats of the Miracle Gel however the top coat was only one application of the Top Coat. I love how long lasting it stayed on. I loved how it looked and it made me confident in wearing the nail polish. I would definitely recommend this to everyone. And I will definitely purchase this product again."
"Easy nail color and shine","2017-07-24","4","When I applied the color it spread smoothly without bubbling. I was able to apply the second coat without trouble and as smoothly as the first one.  The top coat applied easily and smoothly too. It has a nice shine even though it looks a little rough. Would have preferred a more subtle color, but that is my personal taste. I hope it really lasts the fourteen days."
"Please add the sponge back!","2021-03-31","5","I have been using this product for 7 or 8 years and absolutely love it.  That being said with the sponge being removed the application/coverage is just not the same.  Please bring it back."
"Easy salon quality manicure at home.","2017-08-12","5","The manicure that I gave myself was as beautiful, smooth, and long lasting as a manicure from the salon. I received several compliments on my nails. It  went on smooth and evenly with very little effort and  just a few brush strokes. It left no streaks or lines. One coat completely covered each nail. The shape of the brush fans out on the nail for easy and perfect application. No constant dripping or mess. By the time I had painted my last nail, I was already able to apply the top coat. It did not smear the color at all. It was just as easy to apply and left my nails shiny and bright. There is no blue UV light needed to set the polish. The color did not chip or fade ever. It stayed as beautiful and fresh as the day I applied it until I removed the polish two weeks later. I would definitely recommend this set to anyone looking to get a salon quality gel manicure at home."
"No Title","2018-03-05","3","I loved the colors and the process when putting on the polish and Gel were very easy. The brush on the polish is shaped for easy sliding on the nail. The only thing I don't like is that it peels off easily. I put on the polish on Saturday and on Sunday it was peeling a little bit."
"Lipstick","2024-12-21","1","I do not like the quality of the product specially thre color"
"Great duo","2017-10-24","4","I received the color Birthday suit which is such a beautiful nude. The top coat gave it a great shine. The nail polish does go on pretty even and after two coats of the nail polish looks very pigmented. I have had it on for 3 days and it still looks good."
"Looks Like Cement","2016-12-16","1","Very disappointed with this. As women age,large pores,lines,etc can be a problem and I am surprised that this product is aimed towards mature skin because it actually accentuates these problems. It looks plastic and settles in every pore,line and wrinkle. Terrible!"
"Where is the applicator???","2021-03-30","4","Last two I have bought the applicator sponge is missing! Why? I have been using this product for years but now may look elsewhere! Very disappointed"
"Easy to apply","2020-12-07","4","I probably should have gone with a lighter shade! Otherwise it is easy to apply and is not heavy on the skin either"
"New Color = Beautiful Nails","2017-07-16","4","Very easy to use. Quick to dry. The top coat is nice and shiny and it does appear like a real gel manicure. It was great having this trial because I used a color (Terra-Coppa) that I normally would not have purchased and I like it a lot! Color is vibrant, super fun and different.  Would definitely recommend this nail polish line to friends and family."
"Maybelline","2020-12-07","5","Yes it was my exact color and and went on smooth love it ."
"This is great","2020-12-07","5","I love love this its great . I will be buying more this and going get my friends try it"
"great smooth coverage","2020-12-07","5","Glided on smooth and blended well. Matched well to my complexion"
"Great color","2017-07-24","4","Well, I'm not a huge fan of putting gel on my nails because it's harder on my nails to remove, but I did really like the color of this polish even though not what I would normally wear; It went on nice and evenly, took a little longer to dry than I would expect, but I liked the fact that the top coat completely protects the polish itself."
"Do try","2017-07-22","5","I had received this to try I must say, I was very skeptical about about the hold up of this product . I never painted my nails with miracle gel I really thought  this would chip however , to my suprise I absolutely love it and the color also . When using the nail polish and top coat here it is a week later and my nails still look the same how I had  painted them ! Definitely would recommend and get all the colors they are beautiful!"
"My new ride or die","2017-10-24","5","Sally Hansen miracle gel is my new ride or die! With such beautiful colors, such a strong and shiny top coat, this is going to be my go to polish. So long salon prices! I'm saving money with a nail polish that looks professional!"
"No Title","2020-06-12","1","The gel polish from sally hansen when used with the top coat peels right off. I am not sure if I have used it incorrectly, but I am so disappointed. Does anyone know if it works better with the UV light? I want an at-home gel polish but this one did not work out."
"Anastasia Beverly Hills eyebrow dip","2022-07-15","5","Using this for 4 years and Litearly fills my eyebrows perfectly and such a great colour it's also smooth so very smooth to apply"
"GOOD UNTIL IT DRIES OUT","2023-01-19","3","This is a great product until it dries out! Once it dries out it gives a very “caked” look to your brows. It lasts forever though and is great for the summer!"
"Pomade","2023-06-09","5","I absolutely love this! It's perfect for a full changed brow look or it's perfect for if you just want to infill your own brows. It seems to 
stay on for a very long time which is always a win."
"All my smooth","2018-10-16","5","Received this lip stick as a sample.  It was so silky smooth and my very dry lips felt so moisturised. I don't find it to be particularly long lasting"
"Gorgeous colors, but does not last long","2016-06-17","3","I love the huge array of available colors (I own 15); however, I was expecting and hoping it would last longer. Even when following directions exactly, they chip dreadfully within a couple of days. I don't have the time to redo them as often as I would need to. Works super well on toes though! You don't use them as much so they take much longer to chip off. :) In the pic, these were only painted two days ago."
"Great polish, but not long lasting","2017-07-20","3","Miracle Gel and Topcoat goes on easily and comes in very attractive colors. However, it chips very easily and does not seem to have staying power on the nails at all.  I kept on having to repaint my nails, on an almost daily basis."
"Sally Hansen Miracle Gel Review","2017-07-22","3","I received Sally Hansen's Miracle Gel & Top Coat in Game of Chromes. I expected silver from the description, but it's Gold. I did a mani-pedi and after 2 days my fingernails are already chipping. My toenails still look good and I expect they will for the 2 weeks this product is supposed to last, but I don't see any difference between the Gel Polish and regular polish."
"Where is the light/medium???","2016-12-02","4","I love this concealer but I can no longer find my color 225 which is a yellow base and falls right between light and medium. I tried every color and none work for me. please consider bringing back this color!"
"EH","2016-11-30","3","I bought this about a month ago. It does not cover my dark circles and creases. It works for my friend, but for people with DARK circles, don't waste your money"
"The Perfect Combination!","2017-07-27","5","Great quality and a nice color for the season.  My nails never looked better.   The miracle Gel does wonders combined with the top coat.  My nails became stronger and the polished last for days, without any chipping."
"The best foundation ever","2025-05-11","5","This is, by far, the best foundation I've ever used. I've used everything from estee Lauder & dior to Maybelline and never loved any of them. Milani foundation is so good- Great coverage, perfect shade, non-drying. Most people can't even tell I'm wearing any. I'll always buy this!"
"Pretty color! Easy to apply.  Lasts long","2022-08-17","3","This nail polish is fairly easy to apply, it would be easier if the polish brush wasn't so thick. But I made do and figured it out fast. The color I received was Sugar Fix and it's very pretty shade of baby blue. It lasts a long time! Definitely lasts longer than some of the other nail polishes I've used. It's easy to remove for a gel polish. I will buy it."
"Just perfect","2017-10-24","5","Easy steps to follow for a durable and beauty result. No need to spend more in the salon when you can do it yourself in the comfort of your home anytime. The variety of color goes perfect with any ocation."
"Beautiful color","2017-07-15","5","I have two teenage daughters. They also used this nail polish. I have had so much trouble with other nail polish going on gloopy, this product went on smoothly! The color is so beautiful. My husband even noticed and complimented the color. We were all surprised how quick this dried. We are all three happy with this product and will be purchasing other colors this weekend."
"At home manicures","2017-11-15","5","After I had my son a couple years ago I decided going to the nail salon wasn't a top priority anymore due to our finical situation. I then began doing my nails at home. I love doing my nail but I hate that I can barely find a nail polish that doesn't chip after a day or two. I really actually was suprised this product worked and didn't chip until about 5 days later. For the drug store price it's definitely worth it and I will be repurchasing."
"Easy to use Nail Polish!","2017-11-03","4","The color stayed on for a week with no chip until I remove it. The color itself Birthday Suit is too light for me since I'm really tan. Its a light tanish beige color. The con I have to wait at least 20 to 30 min to dry. I applied 2 coats with the top coat because with one coat is too sheer. Overall i do like it but not love it becausr it took forever to dried. Especially having two youngs kids i have a busy life I'm always on the go."
"No Title","2025-05-11","5","just make it but I'm very well and it looks good one to this life"
"Best product","2020-12-07","5","I would definitely suggest this product since it’s so easy to use."
"Great Coverage","2020-12-07","5","The color is perfect for my skin and it covers blemishes and dark eye circles while leaving my skin looking less wrinkled."
"Great","2020-12-07","5","Love this so much! It covers perfectly! I will be recommending to friends!"
"No Title","2018-04-21","5","A money saver 
I, like many girls like to save money. The gel line is just that-money saved with salon quality nails.
I love the applicator-thick.
The gel is smooth and not sticky.
Even the colors, no matter which you choose, is great.
Sally gel is my choice for that flawless look."
"I received the wrong color","2022-04-08","5","This is my favorite brand and type of lipstick, but I received the wrong color so I gave it away. It's too bad I live so far away from a bigger city, not sure I want to waste my time reordering if I might get the wrong color again."
"No Title","2019-08-08","5","I looooove this little bottle of top coat. It give you a high shine, dries quickly, and helps your nail polish last longer. I have bought several bottles of this in the past and would highly recommend. It goes on smooth and helps keep my nails from breaking or peeling."
"Doesn't look good on me","2020-01-14","3","I don't really want to say this is a bad product, it just wasn't good for me. Being a matte finish, it's not very smooth, in fact kinda sticky. I should have thought it through before I bought it."
"Perfect Gel Polish","2017-10-24","5","I received this beautiful Terra Copper nail color from Home Testers Club in exchange for my honest opinion. I love gel polish and this was perfect especially without the need of UV light. The color was a little dull at first but after the 2nd coat and the gel top coat it really brought out the color. This color is perfect for fall and halloween."
"Best nail polish out there!","2017-07-22","5","I have been wearing it  all week and it has been wonderful. My nail polish usually chips within a day and I did not have that problem with this nail polish. I will be buying more colors for this style. Definitely a keeper. Thank you for a chance to test it!"
"No Title","2020-03-29","3","For some reason I can't get this color to set. I paint my nails I wait 20+ minutes, and it will feel dry to the touch. Once I put the matching clear coat on top it won't dry and goops up. I've had it set correctly 2 times. I know it's not the top coat because it works very well with other polishes."
"Aweosme","2020-02-28","5","I love the shade of this color and it is so moisturizing. would definitely recommend it."
"Perfect healthy glow","2025-05-08","5","I get compliments on the way my skin looks all the time. I love how it gives me the coverage I need without being to heavy. and the dewy finish gives me a healthy younger look."
"My favorite concealer","2020-11-26","5","It doesn’t last as long as Tarte’s, but this color blends best with my skin tone. I like the convenience of the applicator!"
"Effective","2025-04-22","4","Packaging was very nice. I liked the texture. It wasn’t cakey or sticky. There was a slight scent which was a nice scent. The shade was nice I had berry blush and it lasted a long time."
"No Title","2020-02-04","5","I really love this polish. I tend to keep my hands busy and when I'm doing something I really go for it. With that in mind, I struggle to keep nail polish on for longer than a few hours. This stuff though I can manage to keep looking nice for multiple days. I have noticed you need to be really patient when splitting"
"Pinky promise!!!!","2017-10-26","5","I tried the Sally Hansen miracle gel and topcoat in Pinky Promise. I absolutely love this color. Pink is my favorite color so I was super excited to try it on my nails. I love the way the polish goes on smoothly and even without the topcoat it still has a nice shine. The steps were super easy and after putting the top coat gel I was extremely satisfied with the overall appearance. I showed my nails off to all my friends. From now on I will be most definitely buying all the Sally Hansen miracle gel products."
"Best polish ever!!!","2017-07-14","5","I loved this gel polish. The color and shine is amazing. I love the fact that I didn't have to apply a separate top coat and it dries so fast. The polish is good for two weeks without a touch up coat."
"Really Nice","2022-10-07","5","Lots of product that will last a long time. Buildable coverage.

Only con is that this product will dry out over time, but it really provides a nice definition and fullness"
"Great Polish!!","2017-07-19","5","I tested the Pinky Promise color Sally Hansen Miracle Gel & Top Coat, I really loved the color, so did my two daughters 17 and 16 yr. It's great that the top coat secures the color and so far it's lasting longer than my regular polish. Bonus is that you don't to go to a profession, the polish does everything on it's own. great stuff!"
"Holy grail","2023-01-19","5","This is my holy grail eyebrow product! I always have a good brow day if I use the dip brow pomade."
"Very pleased with this polish","2017-08-13","4","I was very pleased with the smoothness of the application and the quick drying time.  The polish and top coat wore very well and lasted when other polishes would have chipped off and needed to be reapplied."
"No Title","2018-05-03","5","This is one of my favorite polishes. It lasts a long time. A little on the expensive side, but the quality of it is worth it. I like all the colors, especially “let's get digital”, and there's another rose gold color that's my favorite. I would definitely buy again and recommend."
"Gel Fingers!!","2017-10-24","5","So, it's just like regular polish BUT, I put on two coats of the color and one layer of top coat, and it is SO SHINY and it actually dries really quickly and nicely. And, surprisingly, it doesn't smell too badly either! It looks really great and I am definitely gonna buy a different color polish to use with the top coat :) The Terra Cotta color looks like it would be really awesome."
"Skeptical then satisfied","2017-07-24","4","The only thing I didn't like was that even with two coats applied, there were spots where the polish was streaked and had bare spots. I liked how fast the polish dried. I work in childcare and wash my hands a ton during the day. I've had it on for five days with no chipping or wearing off at the tips of my nails. The shade of pink is very nice too."
"Color was great, topcoat not so much.","2022-08-04","3","So I loved the color! But the topcoat left me not so happy. It's supposed to be a sugar topcoat, so that it gave it a textured look.  But it made my nails feel like there was sand in there. I wasn't really impressed with it. But I can say that it lasted a good 2 weeks in my nails without chipping."
"No Title","2021-05-10","5","Hey have tried Anastasia Beverly Hills eye shadow, I like the texture and healthy glow."
"No Title","2019-10-30","4","Such a good colour, and the product lasts forever totally worth the money, great bang for your buck"
"Need to listen","2016-11-27","3","You need to listen to and heed these reviews. The product is great. It did a very good job of covering the large dark spot on my face. Much better than the more expensive products I've tried. But I only got about 3 applications from the very poor twist applicator. Then it stopped dispensing the concealer. I tried getting the top off to apply it manually but couldn't do it. So PLEASE. If you change the applicator I'll definitely buy it again."
"THERE IS NOT A SHADE AVAILABLE FOR BROWN SKIN","2016-11-09","1","Why is there not a shade available for people of a darker complexion?"
"Love for toes","2022-08-03","4","This polish is great!  It really looks like gel and looks great on my toes. It is nice and thick which is honestly the look I like but isn't everyone's cup of tea. The color is very opaque and 2 coats works great. It does need a top cot to be shiny but it is self leveling so very easy to apply."
"Sally Hansen Miracle Gel First Time Use","2017-07-26","4","The Sally Hansen Miracle Gel went on easily and perfectly smooth. I applied the top coat over the gel coat and got a super shiny finish. It dried fairly fast and looks amazing. The gel polish is just the right consistency and isn't runny. There was no clumping  when applying a second coat of gel. I will definitely be purchasing more of this product in other shades."
"So Pretty","2022-08-04","5","I tried this Sally Hanson Miracle Gel in the shade Sugar Fix and the color is beautiful.  What I like most about this product is the wide brush. It makes it so simple to polish your nails. My polish lasted for 2 weeks without chipping.  I definitely recommend this product."
"Clear & Quick & Pizzazz!!!","2017-10-27","4","I received Terra-Coppa to experience. Not necessarily a color for me.  However, the formula of the polish is very much to my liking. I do my own nails and the consistency was perfect. Not too thick and not too thin.  The nail coverage was smooth and complete. It dried quickly and drama free of any smudges or smears. The top coat dried clear and quick as well.  Bonus, these products do not need UV light.
Win win."
"Salon quality manicure at home!","2017-08-11","5","I love this nail polish!  You get deep, rich color without having to apply layer after layer of polish.  The top coat provides excellent protection.   My manicure has lasted well past the 14 day mark.   I would highly recommend this polish to anyone who wants a salon quality manicure at home."
"No Title","2020-05-09","5","So I purchased this gel set with everything going on during covid and not being able to get my nails done. I must say it holds up very nicely without chipping. Mine last me about a week. I apply 2 or 3 coats of the color and then 2 coats of the top coat and let it dry for a good 20-30mins. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to do their own nails but also not wanting the polish to be chipped after a few days. This stuff is great!"
"Great on mature skin","2025-03-24","5","Just tried today.  The color match was perfect using their shade test.  I had barely prepped my skin.  I opened it up as soon as it arrived and just slapped it on.  Hours later still looks great!;"
"Very satisfied","2025-03-11","5","I bought this and I am very happy with this product"
"The best","2025-03-09","5","Great makeup love how it hides all your imperfections"
"The best tiny stick for a bit of color","2025-04-21","5","Love love love this tint stick- it adds the perfect amount of color and the shade seems to work perfectly with my skin. It’s not too hard or dewy- perfect consistency. Would highly recommend"
"Great","2025-03-11","5","I believe it’s my first time trying this brow lift pencil. I am very happy with how it applies, it’s the perfect ash brown shade for my brows. The pigment is just enough. I’m a fan."
"Good product & color, chips in 2 days.","2017-08-15","4","I've always been a fan of Sally Hansen nail products and was not disappointed by the Miracle Gel & Top Coat. This was a lovely color and a great shine from the gel-like topcoat and I enjoyed it. I will admit to some disappointment, I had hopes that the gel-like topcoat would prevent chipping, but it did not last any longer than any other of the Sally Hansen products I have. Trust me, that won't stop me from buying more colors though!"
"Get salon results at home only 2 steps.","2017-10-30","5","I have achieved salon results from the comfort of my home.  I really loved this polish not to mention I applied it in 2 easy steps.  It only required one coat of each the polish and top coat.  In addition, It dried really quickly without sitting my hands under a light.   Furthermore, the shine that the top coat provides is amazing.  I"
"Better Than Regular Polish","2017-10-26","4","I thought it applied really well, especially love the wider brushes. It was really easy, just apply two coats of color and then the top coat. It really looked like a professional gel manicure (except the natural slip ups when painting my dominate hand!) It did last longer than regular polish, but not too long without getting chipped. I would say I got about 3 days without chipping (compared to less than a day with regular polish.) Overall I really enjoyed Sally Hansen Miracle Gel and the convenience of a gel manicure without the special lighting."
"Long lasting non chip nail polish","2017-07-17","5","Unlike other nail polishes that chip so easily, this didn't. I also loved how smooth and shiny this made my nails look."
"Goes on nicely and stays on a long time!","2017-11-15","4","The nail polish went on very nicely. It dried rather quickly and had a beautiful shine. The only disappointment was that at about day 9 it did start chipping and peeling. But that is still way better than my normal nail polishes!"
"No Title","2020-06-06","4","Love this shade. Really pops with my skin tone. And it didnt take many coats for the polish to stay on my nails. It stays on for weeks as well if you take care off them well. Definitely recommend this for nail art fans."
"fast drying","2017-10-24","4","it dried very quickly. I like that you didnt need the lamp . I have had it on for a few days and no chips yet, I work with my hands all the time and normal polish never stays on as long as this has. so for the first time trying this i give it a thumbs up"
"Inaccurate color. Freaky weird. Unusable.","2019-07-13","2","Bad color"
"No Title","2020-02-05","5","I've only used the clear top coat Miracle Gel Nail Polish. I don't like the colored polishes because I find that they take too long to dry; however, the clear coat on top of a normal polish allows for my manicures to last longer than usual before chipping!"
"Great quality","2017-08-17","4","I bought this a few weeks ago for the first time, at first I held out on buying it because it is pricier than other nail polishes, but it was worth the buy. The nail polish lasted a long time without chipping and the gel effect looked great. Worth the buy."
"SALLY HANSEN MIRACLE GEL... a must have.","2017-10-24","5","I loved my Sally Hansen Miracle gel and top coat. I usually get no chip manicures so I was sceptical but I've had it on for 4 days so far and it still looks fresh. I've worked, washed dishes cleaned the house and they still look like I just came out of the salon. Love it"
"Beautiful coverage!","2025-02-16","5","First experience. May have to go a little lighter. Beautiful coverage similar to double wear by estee lauder.*****"
"Perfect shade, coverage %26 consistency...","2025-02-11","5","Perfect shade and solid coverage without feeling too heavy.  It's not too drying or too moisturizing."
"Great formula. Horrible applicator","2020-11-25","5","I rarely find concealers I am happy with, and LOVING this one. IMHO this product is best for under-eye, not blemishes. It brightens & sinks into skin. Extremely minimal creasing (which I always have an issue with, probably cause I'm not great at doing the powder thing). But I can't see how everyone can be happy with the applicator. Very unhygienic. When you click for more product, it takes a while to actually come out. You would have to have the product already sitting there in the sponge, prior to use. Per the Youtuber I saw recommend, I ripped off the sponge. After use, I do one click so its ready for the next morning. A proper fine tip tube would be better. Added a photo of sponge ripped off, if anyone was curious."
"No Title","2020-11-22","4","Needed a new concealer and found this one highly recommend on TikTok. Normally I get a little creasy under my eyes but so far not seeing that with this product!"
"Love it","2017-10-24","5","I got to try sally Hansen miracle gel and top coat for free from home tester club. I like the color of the nail polish because it is a pretty color. I like how the color looks on my nails. The top coat is very good because when I put it on my nails it makes the nail polish color stay on my nails."
"Amazing coverage","2017-07-14","5","It is rare to find truly innovative nail polish, but Sally Hansen has done it.  Not only is this product as good as gel polish that requires light to cure, but the coverage is amazing.  First of all, the polish just seems higher quality and more color-saturated than other polishes I've tried.  It also has this amazing brush - it's thick and double wide and makes polishing a snap.  And seriously, you can get away with one coat!"
"No Title","2019-07-13","5","A last forever and it's really easy to use it can be a little expensive but again compared to other brands there are a lot more expensive than this one but it lasts a long time and it's just a really good brand that I go to I definitely would recommend"
"Lots of Simmer","2017-10-24","3","The Terra Coppa was super shimmery, especially after adding the gel top coat. I work in a pre-school, and at home and within 24 hours, even following the directions my tips were showing wear. However, I didn't have any chipping and the color was very vibrant."
"Like this product","2017-06-22","3","Only put on 1 coat of color the the first time I used this. Color last about a week. I was thrilled! Used 2 coats the second use and it started coming off the tips. Like the product and will use again just not weekly. Curious to see how my nails hold up with use of product and acetone remover."
"High Quality Product","2017-07-19","5","I can tell these are high quality. They went on easy and looked beautiful when I was finished. I asked my spouse how it looked and he even liked it. I received both bottles free for testing purposes and this is my own honest review."
"Beautiful","2017-08-23","5","I loved it. It made my nails so nice and pretty and I got lots of compliments on the color and I've bought several colors since receiving this sample. I've also recommended my friends to buy this product as well."
"2 and 1 foundation","2025-01-26","5","Love this foundation I get so many compliments.
Out is flaw less."
"Super product!","2016-11-05","4","I have purchased this product 3 times now and in between bought other concealers and of course they are not used. I keep going back to this amazing concealer. IT covers and highlights my undereye circles and any blemishes I have. Love love love"
"No Title","2020-08-02","4","All Sally Hansen nail products are amazing. Some colors require a few layers for the desired color and they occasionally can be a bit pricey for nail polish but other than that I love it."
"Doesn't last","2017-05-22","2","I tried this hoping it would last longer than regular polish, but it is about the same. 3-4 days and I work in an office.  Last longer on toes and works well there, but not on fingers."
"Great for daily life","2017-07-15","5","This product goes on smooth and easy. I usally have issues when applying my polish with chipping or movement and this polish really stays in place"
"No Title","2018-05-13","5","If you're looking for a cute nail polish that will last you a while this is one to go for I've had my nail polish on for 3 weeks and it still has not shipped and the gloss on it is pretty nice"
"No Title","2019-10-25","5","Very long lasting. It takes quite awhile to dry, but lasts long once dried completely. Be sure to use in combination with miracle gel top coat for full effect."
"Works like regular nail polish, lasts like gel","2019-09-23","4","While traveling, I needed to touch up my nails, but I hadn't brought my nail kit. Stopped by Target and got a few colors of the Miracle Gel and I'm having a hard time switching back to regular gel polish! Goes on smooth, dries like nail polish, and I love that I don't have to use my lamp. Looks great on toe nails too!"
"No Title","2020-02-22","4","Dries nice and even. A bit thicker than other polish. Does not last as long as real gel but does give that glossy gel look. If you like a color and will be using it often then it might be worth the price."
"Amazing pedicure color","2022-08-04","4","No 3 feet pics! This color is amazing on the toes as a nice, bright summer color. The polish dries super quickly without having to curate under a UV light, and two coats makes it very opaque. I like this color a lot and I'm glad I found it because it's my new favorite! I've never tried any of the sally Hansen gel polishes before and this one is amazing."
"No Title","2021-09-11","4","I have the 739 fish teal braid color and I love how it last but 100% if you don't buy step 2 then it chips right away. Also tip if you have week nails makes sure you put nail harder a week before and then apply. You thank me later"
"It's okay.","2017-12-15","3","This polish is okay. It didn't last as long as expected. I have other “gel” polishes that don't require lighting that last longer."
"Great price for such an amazing product","2024-12-13","5","A creamy foundation which i what i need for my dry againg skin. The color is perfect and as long as nothing changed with the formula, I will keep buying it. It's for sure one of my favorites."
"No Title","2020-03-05","5","This is a great top coat that makes my nails look really shiny. It also helps my manicure last a lot longer than it typically would without it. It's a little on the pricey side I think for Sally Hansen, but I definitely recommend it"
"Cheaper version than a lot of others!!","2024-12-11","5","Never had used it before. Had always used Revlon Colorstay foundation. It’s gone up and up in price to where I think it’s unreasonable. Anyway, I found this item and it is a match to my Colorstay and cheaper. Very happy with this cheaper version."
"Perfect coverage","2016-09-15","5","This concealer gives me perfect coverage and is amazingly light! Love it!"
"No Title","2018-04-11","5","The Sally Hansen Miracle Gel polish in Love Me Lilac is a gorgeous shade that just stays put. As part of the 2-step system, my mani lasted over a week! I've tried 2 other shades from this line and this one is the most opaque. You can definitely get away with one coat but two is perfect. Sally Hansen® Miracle Gel™ Nail Polish"
"AWESOME COVERAGE","2024-12-02","5","I love this makeup.  I have bought three so far and will continuing purchasing.  Not sure if the company is aware that all the tops of all three of the containers I purchased do not stay on and they have all cracked or broke.
Needs some tweaking to fix the tops and make them more sturdy to stay tightly on."
"Great value","2024-11-18","5","Same as drugstore at lot less money. Great savings."
"I love the high shine ❤️","2017-10-30","4","I loved the wider, rounded end of the brush. It made it much easier to apply an even coat. I love the bright, brilliant hue of red and the high shine is fantastic! I love this shade of Red! I can't stop looking at my nails."
"Like having a salon at home!","2017-08-22","4","This was a convenient, easy to use product. Much more convenient and affordable than going to a salon for gel nails. This applied easily, with smooth strokes, no clumping or streaking. It dried pretty quickly. The 2 step process didn't take long at all. The color was very nice with just the right amount of shine. My manicure lasted much longer than typical nail polish would. Less chips and and imperfections through out the week than I would normally experience. Had to reapply less frequently. It was easy to remove."
"Best color ever","2022-06-02","5","❤️"
"Sally Hansen Miracle Gel Nail Polish","2017-07-27","2","I really wanted to love Sally Hansen Miracle Gel Nail Polish and Top Coat. However, for me it did not stay on any longer than a cheap 99 cent nail polish. The shade Rhapsody Red was classically beautiful, applied smoothly, and could have taken just one coat to look good."
"A M A Z I N G !!","2022-07-24","5","for me anastasia pomade is easier to use and have a smooth finish, it also last longer, it's  better then any eyebrow pencil, i will always buy this one!"
"No Title","2021-06-09","4","This product really takes so practice to use. You can over do it fast, sometimes your eyebrows will look blocky and big, but once you get the hang of it it's perfect."
"DIPBROW","2022-12-28","3","I've used this product i couple different times now and the main thing i've noticed is when you get close to the end it dries up ￼an￼d you have the throw it away. when you first open it, it works wonders for your brows."
"Like","2016-09-04","5","This I love but the foundation kind of sucks! Love this like I said but it is so hard to find near me I have to go so far to get it at ulta BUEATY"
"No Title","2018-04-19","5","This has stayed on my toe nails for a week! No chipping. Its super glittery and beautiful but it's not a pain to take off when you're ready to. I will buy more colors! Great formula and staying power"
"Loved the shine","2017-10-27","5","I loved how the color stayed longer then my regular. Nail Polish and it's been 4 days now and it still looks good I wasn't sure if I'd like the red color I'm more of a light colors but I loved it, this will be my new nail Polish from now on."
"polish and top coast, sugar and shiny","2022-09-14","1","I have tried two polishes and the sugar top coat and the shiny top coat.  I have found the nail polish of both colors gets tiny bubbles and the sugar top coat is really bumpy.  I also found when applying shiny top coat, it seemed to remove polish.  I waited 5 to to minutes before each layer.   What don't I understand"
"Super fantastic shine","2017-08-11","5","It goes on easy and smooth. You don't have to put coat after coat for the color to be stunning. The top coat is my favorite part. It's brings that high wet look shine and makes your nails look super fantastic. Both the color and top coat also dry quickly, so you're not waiting forever for them to dry. Overall I absolutely love this product!"
"Fit me foundation creamy beige 122+ ? Concealer","2020-11-21","4","Hi, I use fit me foundation creamy beige 122. Which color of this concealer would be best match with my foundation. Please recommend me"
"Awesome polish!","2017-10-25","5","This polish goes on very smooth and soft. It only needed two coats to full cover my nails and be the thickness that I like. The top coat also goes on smooth, and was the perfect finisher. After 5 days my nails are still going strong despite doing dishes multiple times, scrubbing the bathroom, and multiple other chores from the day.  The color also wa perfect for me. This is exactly the color I would have bought for myself! I would definitely recommend this product to any family or friend looking to try an awesome new polish. And even better, you don't ha e to go to the salon to get long last, gel like nails! This definitely holds its own against a professional manicur."
"brow","2022-09-03","5","my favourite brow product makes my eyebrows look so natural and beautiful I'm obsessed by anastasia beverly hills eyebrow   recommend"
"No Title","2019-07-19","5","Any time I'm doing an at-home mani/pedi I HAVE to make sure I have this on hand. It prevents staining, and is very easy to remove. It is affordable and I've been able to find it at nearly every drugstore local to me. I sincerely do not like to paint my nails without this product and would suggest using it to anyone who does their nails at home!"
"Great product that is easy to apply!","2017-08-17","5","Went on smooth and dried fast without a uv light. It lasted about a week before it started to chip on the tips. It probably would have last longer but I type all day long. The color was really pretty. Overall it's a great product!"
"Smooth application","2017-07-27","5","I am very pleased with the product. It was very easy to apply color on my nails with its brush.  The brush helps to make the application very smooth . The nail color was looking very good on my nails.  The nail color dries fast after application. Also it stays on nails for quite long time."
"No Title","2020-04-21","5","I love any of the Sally Hansen nail polish it really applies my nail as a gel like this is very easy to remove once you are finished with your nail polish I love how it looks it looks professional and it's affordable you could buy this at the drugstore."
"Nice","2022-12-28","5","I really like how smooth and pigmented it is. It doesn't dry up really fast like some other makeup brands, I would recommend it"
"Anazing","2023-01-12","5","Love this. It goes on easy, the color is amazing. It lasts all day and is really waterproof. I use an angled brush to aoply"
"No Title","2021-09-28","5","I have very light eyebrows.  This Dipbrow was a lifesaver.  I would defiantly buy it again!  Anastasia Beverly Hills Dipbrow Pomade 44 This will be a definite buy again item :)"
"No Title","2021-08-25","5","Waterproof as well as 24 hour long lasting wear it's a great product to work with as well as easy to apply"
"Love it","2022-12-28","5","I love this product so much. It makes my eyebrows look great and the makeup up goes on smooth. The shade is also a perfect match definitely worth it."
"Lip Stain","2020-01-05","5","This does not come off until you wash it off. I use a color close to my natural lips, and it looks as good at 7 pm as it did at 6 am."
"Poor applicator","2020-11-20","1","The applicator is poorly designed. No matter how many times I twist, no product comes out. This is it worth the money. This issue is a common complaint. Maybelline should consider redesigning ."
"Glides like butter !","2025-03-11","5","This brow pencil glides so smoothly. It really helps enhance your eyebrows. It also lasted a full 8 hour work day without smudging or loosing color."
"Wonderful product, excellent colors!","2017-10-24","5","Beautiful shade and omg it doesn't chip at all! I am absolutely in love with how beautifully this sets and looks! The top coat really seals the color in but the color itself is gorgeous even without the top coat! I am so happy to have received this because I had wanted to try it but wasn't sure how well it was going to work, im very pleased that it's such an excellent polish! What an excellent option for girls on the go, I hate having to redo my polish constantly and this is not going to have to be redone until I'm ready to change the color!"
"Soo good!","2022-12-30","5","Dip brow has been a staple in my makeup drawer. It's so creamy, easy to use, I can shape it easily with concealer and it's such a staple!"
"Easy to apply! Looks beautiful!","2017-10-26","4","Loved the color and the ease of putting it on.  I put two coats of gel color and two of the top coat.  I am a busy mom with lots of responsibilities so I'm working at things all the time.  Unfortunately, the color came off the tips of my nails within 24 hours; not on all the nails but eight out of ten.  That left my thumbs with the only full color the next day.  I still think it is a very nice polish and will try it again."
"Perfect nails","2017-10-26","5","I would definitely recommend the Sally Hansen Miracle Gel and Top coat. The miracle gel is a very vibrant and bold color. The brush is a thick brush that spreads wide to cover the nail while brushing on the gel. The wide brushed helped to cover the whole nail with less swipes. The gel went on smooth and evenly. The top coat was very thick but it glided easily on the nail and added an extra shine to the nail color. The top coat has really helped to prevent fading and chipping and has made nail color last a whole lot longer."
"Great product!!!","2017-08-08","5","First of all the color they sent me is the most I liked is beautiful. It is a neutral tone that combines with everything. The brush that comes with the enamel makes it easy to paint it in one pass which is a most for me, the smell of the enamel nones strong which I also liked a lot. The quick dry enamel and my nails were painted 7 days. I definitely recommend it."
"No Title","2020-04-10","4","Love this product for truly salon like results without the price! Easy to apply, 2 coats of color and 1 coat of the gel step 2. No mini lamps required at all. This has lasted just as long as a gel mani for me! I will say the lighter colors do start to crack and the cracks are visible so I would stick to darker shades only."
"Best at home nail color on the market!","2017-11-15","5","It goes on smooth and even. I didn't even do a second coat, like I normally do. The top coat makes it look professional! All o my friends and coworkers Ave complemented me on the color as well. I would recommend this to all who are looking for a cute nail color that's going to last a while!"
"Doesn't make your eyebrow too dark!","2023-02-09","4","I actually have dark brown hair and I can never find a brow gel to match but this matched perfectly! definitely recommend."
"Dip brow","2022-05-08","4","Doesn't smudge at all throughout the day . Can give a bold or natural look depending how much you apply . Also easy to use"
"Love the Product, but missing my color :(","2016-09-01","5","I've been using this product for years. I love how it glides on and truly does hide blemishes. However, my favorite color is 320 HONEY and I can't find it anywhere. I finally tried on line & then heard it's been discontinued? Please bring it back!"
"BEST UNDER EYE CONCEALER EVER","2016-08-21","5","This is honestly the best concealer I've ever used for dark under eye circles. I often use it alone under my eyes and set it with compact powder and it gives an instant brightening effect, hiding my dark circles at the same time."
"Easy to use and long wearing!","2017-10-23","5","The Sally Hansen Miracle Gel & Top Coat were a breeze to apply. Two quick coats of color and one final application of Top coat. They dried quick and hard and have lasted ever since! I'm not a huge fan of this color, I prefer darker shades,  but I do like the sparkle factor that it is."
"Overall Review: Smooth and Long-Lasting","2017-10-28","5","The nail polish went on really smoothly and I had no problems with clumps or wrinkles in the coat.  It stayed on for a reasonable amount of time (a few days, whereas most nail polish I use comes off in a day), and when I wished to take it off, it came off easily and smoothly with my nail polish remover."
"Sally hansen miracle gel is awful.","2022-08-17","1","This is the second product I've tried from the miracle gel range and it's just as bad as the last. The polish is thick and gloopy  and still somehow takes three THICK coats to completely cover. I have been doing my own nails for like 20 years, this is still the worst polish I've ever used.  And it doesn't last more than 24 hours to boot. HARD PASS. I hate it."
"Smooth shiny texture","2017-10-26","4","I wasn't a fan of the color. I guess I though I would like it but didn't to much. Now it looks good on the nail, no bubbles and it did dry on the time said of 5 minutes each. I hate touching my nails thinking their dry and their not. I like fixing my nails and they last. I also like when the finish product is smooth and shiny. I like using sally Hansen miracle gel and will definitely use other colors."
"Fast drying but thin polish","2017-10-27","4","The brush was a bit wide for me (I have small nails so the brush size made it hard for precision). It also took 3+ layers of the polish to become opaque (most polishes take 2 layers).However, I do appreciate how quickly it dries!"
"Not too special","2017-07-22","3","I received the Game of chromes color which reminded me of sand and summer. Its not my preferred shade. I applied as directed with the top coat and it lasted about five days before it started to chip which I was a little bout disappointed by because I expected it to last a little longer. Overall I liked it about the same as my current polish."
"No Title","2018-03-30","5","Love it! Super impressed with the long lasting coat. Sally Hansen never fails me! Definitely the best top coat I've had drug store wise. Very easy to apply, the smell isn't terribly strong, and it lasts FOREVER!"
"GoodbyeSalon!HelloSallyHansenMiracleGel!","2017-07-29","5","I really loved how my nails looked using Sally Hansen Miracle Gel & Top Coat.
The polish lasted longer than any other nail polishes I've ever used!
I'm very happy with this product."
"150 is the best for dark circle","2016-08-20","5","This product has been recommended by so many bloggers. At first I ordered a ""fair"", the texture is moisture and smooth, but it didnt cover my dark circle like recommendation. I tried 150 Neutralizer and understand why it is soooooooo popular. 150 is a little bit orange, will be wired if you use it in the whole face but it is the best for dark circle! My dark circle is a little purple and green, which can be perfectly covered by 150. My only compliant is the brush. I hate the sponge. It is very likely to use too much with the sponge. And the remain on the sponge may grow some bacteria. So I remove it and apply it with my finger. It would be my favorite if Maybelline gave it a normal brush (just like the ""fit me"" concealer)"
"Wow! It really lasts!!","2021-06-26","5","Follow the directions and it works! Apply the color, wait a minute, then apply the moisture balm. You can apply the moisture bomb all day long when you feel like you need moisture but the color stays! No lipstick on the coffee cups are on the facemasks and lasting color."
"GOOD, YA'LL...with room for improvement","2020-11-19","4","I've ALWAYS been a high-end makeup junkie because I've never had luck with drugstore products. Lately, I'm trying to expand my horizons and be smarter with my money. This product is GOOD, ya'll. It stays put all day (coverage comparable to Tarte Shape Tape, but not as drying on the under-eye). Definitely better than my beloved NARS. I put on a couple dots and it easily covers my sleepless nights as a college student. and does not budge as long as you set with powder. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars? The applicator is messy. I keep it upright and twist slightly. The product basically keeps leaking out which is fine if you're careful with it, but gross to look at and definitely NOT travel-friendly. Maybelline, please make this in a doe-foot applicator. THEN, it would be a 5-star, in my opinion."
"No Title","2020-11-18","5","This has quickly become my favorite concealer. It’s very thin and light without compromising coverage. I have worse dark circles than I’ve seen on anyone else, and this works wonders without being cakey and settling into fine lines."
"Free Sally Hansen Miracle Gel","2017-11-15","5","I liked how it last up to 14 days and it goes on smoothly bother polish and top coat. As a stay at home mom I don't have the funds to get my nails done, but using this is just like the same thing you get done in a nail salon only cheaper too. I recommend this to anyone who paints their nails or toe nails"
"Goes on smoothly and dries fast.","2017-08-08","4","Worked great on my fake fingernails. Went on smoothly and dried really fast. Didn't go on as smoothly on my natural toe nails but still I was satisfied. Lasted longer than any other polish I've used."
"... Fawn is my go-to base color and does a great job standing on it's own as well","2017-03-04","5","Forever Fawn is my go-to base color and does a great job standing on it's own as well. I am very fair complected and this is a product and color I order online because it's very hard to find in the store on the shelf."
"Love this polish","2017-07-18","5","I really loved this nail polish , I loved the color also. It went on really smooth and nice coat not to thick and not to thin but a perfect consistency of the polish. I do see my self buying these polishes and not spend so much on manicures, when I have these perfect polishes at a good afforadable price."
"Amazing","2022-04-06","5","I have used this a few times now for my brows and it makes them look amazing and stays on for ages especially when I'm out"
"Easy to use!","2015-11-21","5","Finally found something that lasts and is easy to apply. As a nurse I am constantly cleaning my hands. I can get a good 7 days at least with this.
You MUST follow the directions to apply the polish and wait patiently between coats of polish for the product to work. I think people who are dissatisfied probably did not. Lots of great colors available. Thank you."
"Disappointed","2017-07-18","1","I was very excited about this product as I have a light for my gel nails, but I thought this would be faster and easier. I was right on the fast and easy part, but after waiting for 20 minutes, I washed my hands and the nail polish peeled off several nails and I easily rubbed off the others. There is no way it stays for 14 days. I was extremely disappointed. I will stick with my light. Maybe someone else who uses regular nail polish will have better luck."
"This polish is great","2017-07-15","4","I love how smoothly the nail polish went on the brush itself is amazing. My only real issue is that I feel like the red in the picture was a lot more deeper than the red I received period while in itself it's a pretty color is not exactly what I was looking for."
"Very inexpensive and very good!","2024-11-03","5","I find your products to be excellent and inexpensive."
"Not for the heavy handed but magic in a bottle","2022-12-15","5","A little goes a long way with the right brush. Definitely complements my skin tone and defines my brows."
"Stays on much longer than other polish","2017-07-24","4","This gel polish and top coat really work! My polish stayed on much longer than my usual manicure and I wash my hands a lot so I really notice how tough a product is when it stays on like this one. I highly recommend buying this over regular nail polish."
"No Title","2020-11-17","3","product has potential but the applicator takes so long to come out. The concealer itself has nice coverage ￼￼"
"No Title","2020-11-14","1","Terrible product! Applicator is the worst and bends and broke on me. Color is not true and does not blend well and leaves a sort of “cast” not worth the money!"
"Sally Hansen's Miracle Gel + Top Coat!!","2017-11-09","5","I love love love this miracle gel and top coat. It's coverage is great, and the color I got is so lovely which was Birthday Suit, and I'm already in love with it. The finish really gives you that gel set look and feel. I can't rave about this product  enough. Love it."
"Great product!!,","2017-10-25","5","I really love this color. I have been wanted to try this product for a while! It was really easy to use! I followed the directions and did two coats, but I must say that the color was already opaque and vibrant only after one coat. It dried really quickly and didn't smear! I have to buy the other colors because I already love the red!"
"No Title","2020-08-15","4","So I do overall like this polish. Obviously, it is not as good as true gel polish and obviously it will likely not be as pretty as when your talented nail artist paints it on your nails. But for the money, it is a good product. My BIGGEST complaint is that I have had the brush bristles fall completely out of two different polishes and that is so disappointing because I just had to throw it away."
"Chips?  Not on these nails!","2017-11-04","5","I wasn't sure about the Miracle Gel Top Coat before trying it, but after applying over the 2 coats of Miracle Gel Color, it looked fantastic! With other nail polish/top coats, I would be chipping within a day. Not anymore!"
"Cannot recommend","2017-07-26","2","This product did not work out as well as I'd hoped.  It is fairly resilient to chipping (better than regular polish), but I had several problems.  First, a few days in, gray lines showed up on my fingers where I guess the polish got scratched.  A few days after that, they lined turned darker (possibly from dye from a pair of black pants).  This made the polish look permanently dirty, and I could not wash it off.  I chose to remove the polish 9 days after first applying it because it looked so bad.  However, this Miracle Gel polish was no more difficult to remove than regular polish, so that was nice.  I can't say I would recommmed the Miracle Gel polish to others, though for some, it may be worth it to have polish that is more resilient."
"Disappointed","2020-11-03","2","I had high hopes for this concealer, but it barely covered my dark circles."
"Love this color","2018-01-08","5","Love this color, goes with everything, and lasts all day—may need to reapply after eating . It’s my go-to color!"
"Not long lasting","2021-08-10","2","Like the color, it does not stay on all day! Maybe only a couple of hours. Very disappointed !"
"Good seller","2021-05-26","5","Received the lip color when expected. Good product. Great seller"
"No Title","2018-11-10","5","Beautiful color gives a light to the eye and color natural I was very impressed by him and I did not give up"
"Love it","2017-11-03","5","I've used Sally Hansen hard as nails for a long time but I've never tried any of the color before. The color looks great and doesn't just chip immediately away with my busy lifestyle unlike some others I've used in the past."
"LOVE","2016-08-10","5","I bought this conclear recently and fell in love! I struggle with very very bad dark circles and this covers them up in no time. I will defiantly will be repurchasing this product!"
"No Title","2020-01-21","5","Love this nail polish it looks so amazing on my nails it's easy to use and apply you dont need a light to care it you get look just like gel light polish I love to buy this again its cost is a good. price for this nailpolish I would recommend others to use or at least try you wont regret it"
"No Title","2020-02-13","5","Such a pretty nude. I love using these gel polishes for when I'm between nail appointments and want a nice manicure at home. It's user friendly for sure and last a long time. I got my friends hooked on this stuff."
"A great product","2017-07-26","4","I really like the Sally Hansen Miracle Gel duo. I used it on my fingers and it was a solid week before it chipped. I will buy it again."
"Great polish","2022-07-31","4","This is great polish. I am pretty active working in the yard and washing dishes. I add a fresh coat every night and the product does not chip off of at least 1 week. I have several of the colors and they all wear well. Def recommend"
"No Title","2019-09-24","5","This is a good choice if you hate soaking your gel nail color off. If applied in at least 2 thin coats, I'd say you can get a solid week of wear. Possibly more if you do 3 coats and if you reapply a top coat every few days. Removal is wonderful. I use 100% acetone and have zero problems."
"Best Gel Nail Polish Ever!!!","2017-11-15","5","This was the best gel and top coat ever! It lasts so long. Mine was on for at least a week. You can even get your hands wet. It's wonderful! I want every color."
"Sally Hansen Miracle Gel","2017-07-27","3","The polish went on easily and dried quickly. The color is  very pretty; a nice neutral that goes with everything. However it doesn't last any longer on my nails than any regular polish that I've tried."
"No Title","2020-07-01","4","This is a pretty decent product. I do wash my hands and dishes frequently so they chip after a day or two. But if you're in a pinch this will be okay. It is pricey which doesn't make too much sense but whatever."
"miracle nail polish","2017-07-21","5","love this nail polish it is different than the one i usually use  the ease of applying it  and the shine"
"I just loved it.","2017-11-04","5","I was so exited to try Miracle Gel Life- Proof Polish from Sally Hansen and the truth is i loved it , its worth trying it so come on and try it you going to love the results."
"Great top coat","2023-04-24","5","This top coat seals it all in! I used this all the time before I started doing gel and I loved it! More than 2 coats for me makes it too thick but that is more than enough to keep the polish in place."
"No Title","2020-10-06","3","I like this a lot its cheap which is amazing. Its just kinda thick and clumpy after so long idk maybe Im doing it wrong"
"The best!","2022-04-20","5","It's long lasting and goes on smooth. I feather it in to fill my bald spots for a more natural look."
"It's perfect for eyebrows","2024-12-18","5","Very creamy, easy to work with, and it's very pigmented. A little of goes a long way. The packaging is simple but cute and easy to carry around if you need to touch up. There's no scent to it."
"Better than high end","2024-10-14","5","Honestly I’ve tried a lot of high end foundations and this is the best. Specially for texture skin. It smooths out and stays all day"
"No Title","2019-06-27","5","I love my Sally Hansen gel nail polish for whenever I'm doing my  marbling nail designs! It goes on easy and blends great! I would definitely recommend to everyone from professional to the at home manicurist!"
"Awesome!","2017-07-20","5","I am sooo happy that I was able to try this product out before purchasing for my review.  Sally Hansen Miracle Gel has truly changed my mind about getting my nails done at the salon.  I love the colors that are available and LOVE that this polish does not chip! I am really rough on my nails and i have found that this polish lasts.  I highly recommend it!"
"No Title","2020-04-26","5","Love the finish of this formulation, it looks like it was done professionally and has the gel look to it like advertised! It also is longer lasting without chipping. Only issue I have with this, is that it's harder than normal nail polish to remove but I figure you gain some you lose some. It may just be due to how well it stays on."
"Great product","2017-10-27","5","Love this Sally Hansen Miracle Gel & Top Coat nail polish it went on very smooth it stayed on my nails and didn't  chip or smear very long lasting so satisfied with this polish I plan on purchasing it for now on great product"
"love my nails","2017-07-20","5","it made my nails look like i went to a salon . i loved the color. i was pleased how easy it was to use. i cant wait to try other colors from this company. thank you for letting me try it .  i will be buying more of this product."
"No Title","2019-07-07","4","I love this brand of nail polish, but this color dries more to a mauve than a light pink.  It's a great value for an at-home mani-pedi.  Dries quickly and lasts about a week.  High shine and doesn't chip on my nails.  I have this in several colors.  I gave this 4-stars instead of 5 because the Regal Rose looks very different after drying than it does in the bottle."
"Love!","2024-10-23","5","I've used this product for years and love it. Long lasting great cool tone for my platinum blond hair."
"Getting there","2017-07-27","4","The color was gorgeous and the thick brush made it easy to apply. Went on smooth and dried relatively quickly. I work as a pet sitter and use my hands a lot for the job. I could tell the polish added strength to my nails but by day 5 I had several chips in my polish on my thumb and pointer finger. By day 6 I removed it and reapplied. I would say it's better than other store bought nail polish but still not as durable as salon options. Would recommend and will most likely purchase other colors."
"Quick, Beautiful and Hard Nails","2017-07-21","5","I liked the color of the polish. It was opaque on tge first coat. It was very quick to dry. The wand seemed wider and sturdier than other polishes. As such, I got most of my nails done in 1 to 2 swipes. After the top coat dried, my nails felt significantly stronger. I can't wait to try other colors!"
"No Title","2018-04-08","5","I love this polish! With working with my hands all day, I need a thicker polish so that it will last. The miracle gel works perfectly for me! I'm not a huge nail salon person, I would rather paint my own at home and these are perfect!"
"Fantistic eyebrows","2024-10-01","5","I found an old jar of this and it still worked so I ordered a new jar. I have very sparse eyebrows so pencils did not work for me. This is wonderful. My eyebrows have never looked so good. I highly recommend this product ."
"Stays in place all day","2024-11-19","5","I like shaping my eyebrows with this pomade it's water proof it lasted on me all day. A little goes a long way. I like how smooth the pomade is also the glass keeps the product fresh."
"It's Ok.","2016-08-05","3","Creamy & pigmented application. Product has a tendency to reflect light. Great for natural lighting. Watch out for the flash when taking photo's! In pictures that use flash, I always see this concealers placement under my eye area. Beware!"

"No Title","2017-04-13","2","I purchased a base coat and top coat kit about 3 months ago.  It worked great!  However, now when I opened the top coat bottle today the brush had fallen off the top and is swimming in the bottle.  Not very happy with this."

"No Title","2019-12-03","5","Sally Hansen is literally the best nail polish brand out there. Hands down. Every other nail polish I've bought after using Sally Hansen has been a disappointment. Sally Hansen for life."
"Sally Hansen Miracle Gel Rocks!","2017-08-11","5","I loved this product! It definitely lasted 14 days and did not fade or look lack luster. I highly recommend all of my favorite Sally Hansen products, this one included!"

"BAD Design!!","2016-07-08","1","What a waste of money this product is. It does cover excellent, but I cannot get the liquid out anymore and it will not come apart so I can try to use it. No matter how many times I push on it to get more out it will not come out,this was expensive!"

A week later I tried to use them and they were stuck together, I was able to open them with great effort. The third time I tried to use them, no matter how much I tried to open the 1 and 2 caps, they wouldn't open. The 1 broke and the 2 never opened. And I cleaned them the second time with acetone."

"No Title","2018-11-09","4","I really liked this product! I'm kind of a makeup junky and I try out many products expensive and drugstore. This is a very well know drugstore product and it goes on very well. It covers up under eye discoloration. The only thing I would say I dislike about this product is the applicator sponge on the top. When you are almost done with it, it gets a bit wobbly and its not a very useful shape for a concealer. For the price of this product, I really liked it and I will be using it again for sure."

"Not impressed","2017-11-11","2","I have used this numerous times and it seems like the day after I apply it it chips and starts to wear off. I do two coats and then the top coat. You'd think that by having a top coat it wouldn't chip and wear off so quickly."

"No Title","2020-09-23","3","I love the color of this one a lot. The applicator isn't too big which makes it easier to apply. I just wish it would last longer for claiming to be a gel polish. It doesn't last nearly as long as the long I get done at the salon."

"Perfect","2016-06-22","5","This was super easy to blend unlike some products. I tried this on without using a makeup primer but it still had a smooth finish by the end of the day. The packaging confused me at first. The concealer was so easy to blend I didn't have to use a damp sponge or a makeup brush, instead I used my ring finger. It didn't erase my dark circles completely but I think it depends on how bad your dark circles are. I do know this product actually helps to erase dark circles by the formula which absorbs into your skin while you have it on. Overall, this product was amazing, it didn't settle into fine line or crust. So far, I don't find any cons about this great product. You are truly getting much more than what you are paying for."

This nail polish dries quickly as long as you don't layer it on thick. I find if the layers are too thick, your nails will chip pretty easily. I would definitely recommend to others!"
"No Title","2020-01-04","3","Okay so I'm just reviewing them as a whole. I love that they last longer than some nail polishes, they are super pigmented. My only complaint is they seem to get thick even when they aren't old. And they take a while to dry so carve out some time lol"
"No Title","2020-05-21","5","They are nice for on the go and it lasts a while. They are a reasonable price. I wouldnt improve it, theres no need to. The application is smooth and nice."
"Cumbersome brush, smooth application","2017-07-25","4","The color was more sheer than expected, and took three coats to get the desired look. However, it went on smoothly and dried quickly. The top coat made it shiny and was thick enough to seem like a high quality top coat. Looking forward to seeing how long it lasts. The one downside was that the brush was a little big for painting my toe nails, leading to more smudges on my skin than I'd like."
"Obsessed","2022-04-16","5","Love all of the Anastasia Beverly Hills products but this great for that natural look and getting your brows to stay in place !"
"No Title","2021-09-01","4","Love the pomade but did not got the full effect when using an angled brush. This stuff is amazing if put it on with an eyebrow wand. Gives you defined and thick brows and lasts all day.￼"
"The best","2023-01-12","5","Love this to really define my brows. You have to be careful to not be heavy handed because it WILL look bad. Stays great and doesnt fade throughout the day."
"Comparable to high end brands","2016-06-13","4","Very good for helping neutralize my dark circles. The product is easy to use and helps cover well. Use in combination with a concealer for maximum effect! Love the packaging. DISCLAIMER: I received this product free for testing. All opinions mine."
"Pros and cons.","2017-11-02","4","I really liked the miracle gel and top coat that I tested. However it did peel off rather quickly and took quite a while longer to dry than I expected. The color was beautiful and it didn't require too many coats to look nice! I'm a huge fan of the top coat and have used it by itself a few times. Overall it's a product I would purchase!"
"No Title","2020-05-03","4","Love this product! this is the best for nails. The price is ok. If ur looking for a good long lasting nail polish i recommend 100% these ones. Sally Hansen Miracle Gel Nail Polish"
"Expecting more!","2017-07-21","3","I like Sally Hansen products but I don't think this polish lasts like a true Gel Manicure does. I painted my nails on Sunday and by Friday it was already coming off of the ends. My nails are quite short so I couldn't paint the ends but it really didn't last well at all. I did use two coats of color and then waited 5 minutes and applied the top coat."
"I love miracle gel!","2017-07-30","4","I am a big fan of the quick dry sally hansen brand and this miracle gel is one step better. I love the brush and how smooth the polish goes on. I have the typical gel that requires the LED light which takes me at least 90 minutes to apply by myself because it is impossible to paint other nails while the one hand is curing because I obviously only have two hands. This nail polish gives the gel effects with application similar to nail polish.  Once I was done with the last finger the first one I painted was completely dry and never smudged (another problem I commonly have with typical polish). I have had it on for one week and it barely has any chips or wear on the end. This is after numerous loads of hand washed dishes, showers, and typical chores."
"No Title","2019-11-07","3","This is a great product to achieve a dramatic or ombré brow. You can get similar product for cheaper with a brush tho. It really takes practice to achieve a nice result. Work slow. This will last forever ! A little goes a long way. Lasts all day too."
"Beautiful color and shine","2017-07-17","3","The nail polish and top coat was easy to apply.  I put on two coats on the polish and I let the nails dry 10 minutes between the coats.  I finished off with one coat of the top coat.  The top coat left a nice shine to the nail polish and the cover is pretty and vibrant.  The issue I have with the product is that it didn't last long before chipping it started chipping the next day on my right hand which is my dominant hand.  I will play around and try two coats of the top coat next time to see if that helps the color stay longer without chipping."
"Sally Hansen Miracle Gel Nail Polish","2017-08-11","5","Sally Hansen Miracle Gel nail polish and top coat is awesome! It applies very easily. I love the shape of the applicator brush which makes it easier to apply. I used it along with the top coat, and my manicure lasted for weeks and did not chipboard all! It was definitely like a professional manicure. I would and have recommended."
"Sally Hansen miracle gel polish","2017-10-28","5","I love this polish! I tried it in red and it's such a pretty, bright color. It goes on SO smoothly. I cannot express that enough. It went on so easy and didn't leave uneven lines. That was the most impressive part to me. It's really shiny. I compared my nails to my mother in law's, who gets her nails done professionally, and they looked the same minus the color. High quality for sure."
"No Title","2020-05-04","5","I love this as a top coat for any nail polish! It works with any brand and helps the polish dry. This is a thick top coat that makes the polish look gel and also helps the polish dry so you can peel it off without making the nails thin. I use this back to back and it does not affect my nails. I have repurchased multiple times!"
"I love this product.","2023-03-09","5","I love this product. It's the perfect brown to give you a beautiful contour and the highlighter is stunning."
"Hang in there","2017-08-11","4","I really don't have any finger nails so polish usually don't stay with me no more then about 3 days. This polish stayed on my nails about 8 days without chipping. I really like the polish and top coat and really surprised me how long it lasted. It's a great product and I will use it when I put on my false nails the shine should be amazing."
"Comparable to Sephora Brands!","2016-06-06","5","DISCLAIMER: I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, however my review is completely unbiased. Absolutely loved this product! Doesn't crease, perfect shade, lasts all day, full under eye coverage!"
"Run don’t walk.","2023-02-28","5","I have been looking all over for a countering palette that is for medium/ dark skin girls. Like other palettes counter was usually black or the exact shade of my skin. I spent so much on other products to try and find a good countering shade and I’m so glad I found it. This is an absolute staple in my makeup routine. All of the shades on their are incorporated into my makeup routine. Honestly just buy it."
"Good product but not salon quality.","2017-07-30","3","Such an easy product to use! The color looked great after application. It definitely does not last as long as getting your nails done at a salon (or anywhere near 14 days).  Mine looked good for about 5 days before it started cracking and chipping; however, I was doing a lot of cleaning and scrubbing around the house without gloves which may have decreased the longevity of the polish. 
The ease and convenience of use was a huge plus though. I would recommend the polish in general because it went on nicely but don't expect to get 14 days wear out of it."
"I call this makeup fixer.","2022-06-24","4","I call this makeup fixer. The powder version is amazing and fix any problems I have with my makeup. The creme formula is a little too oily for me and leaves me looking greasy hours later. I love the highlighter in the powder version though"
"Best gel polish out","2017-09-01","5","Honestly I didn't think the color would fit well. But I was so surprised beautiful color. Smooth going on and cant say it enough long lasting no chip gel polish its been 2 weeks still no wear or chips.  Love it so much. Can't wait to buy more colors."
"Great Color Polish with long Dry","2018-01-27","4","I really loved my Sally Hansen Miracle Gel & Top Coat. The shine lasted a little over a week but not quite 14 days. I loved the color but was bothered by how long boats coats took to dry. I don't have a lot of time to do my nails, having to wait for both coats to dry out me off a bit from buying the polish again. But the color is to die for !"
"Great Product","2017-11-06","4","I like the product and the coverage it gives my nails but I would choose a different color. Sally Hansen Miracle Gel and Top Coat are great and did last longer than my initial expectations. I recommend this product to anyone who uses their hands daily for cleaning and any other form of using water, cleaners, and work."
"Great","2016-06-03","4","I love this concealer,gives the perfect coverage and blends like a dream. I received this in a voxbox from influenster and I've been using it non-stop ever since. Its amazing under the eyes and also to highlight."
"Miracle Gel is fun and easy!","2017-10-19","4","Overall I would have to say I was pretty impressed with the Sally Hansen Miracle Gel & Top Coat. I loved the color. It was beautiful. I also was very impressed with the gel top coat. A couple of things that I wasn't greatly fond of was, that I felt it took quite a bit of time to dry. Being that it was gel, I guess I thought it would dry quicker. Also, I tried the top coat with a non Sally Hansen polish just to see how that would work and it wasn't good. So you definitely have to stick with the same product. All in all though, I was pretty pleased with it. Thank you very much for allowing me to participate in this tester. It was alot of fun!"
"Painful Burning Sensation","2016-06-02","1","I was extreamly dissapointed in this product. I was very excited to try this and had seen positive reviews but within seconds of applying it the first time I was met with a horrible burning sensation. It was so bad I had to rush and wash it off."
"No Title","2019-01-24","5","I love Sally Hansen polishes and this is no exception. These last longer than more prestigious brands on my nails and they always keep their shine. They also seem to dry faster to me and they always go on super smooth."
"No Title","2020-07-01","4","Miracle Gel works beautifully, but you need to know how to use it. Don't pull down hard and drag the brush, but sweep/tap it lightly across with the brush. You'll get more of a car-finish look with absolutely no streaking. Go outside if you can (only between coats or when you're finished) and the UV sensitive ingredients will cure & harden the finish."
"nice product","2014-08-14","4","I got this product complementary from influenster for my review. Anyways, I would buy it! It stayed on for 2.5 weeks! It's still on, but chipped. Anyways, I'd like to try thr other colors, just it's a bit pricey."
"Gorg polish","2018-01-28","4","I thought this was a great product my biggest issue is that I have oily nail beds so polish does not hold well to my nails.  I was super optimistic since this is a gel base product but , it didn't stay much longer than most. I loved the color I received and it was so easy to use, it was gorgeous and shiny on my nail it just did not stay past three days on my nails! I fully love this product though much better than most polish I have tried"
"Outlasts the competition!","2017-11-03","5","I love this nail polish! It dried fast and lasted a week without chipping, fading, or flaking. The color is a beautiful rose gold color, it goes with everything. The best part is you don't need a light to achieve a great manicure. This is a great product"
"It's a pretty good","2022-06-24","5","It's a pretty good product I love it goes with Earth tones and I recommend this it was a gift I recommend any woman with a dark skin region from any continent try this out"
"Great tone easy to use.","2017-07-30","5","Sally Hansen Miracle Gel & Top Coat is a great product.  I received the Terra coppa color and it looked great with my skin tone.  It is super easy to apply just do the base and follow it with the included top coat.  I felt it dried is adequate time and I was impressed at how long it lasted.   I am a busy mom and my nail polish tends to wear off quickly, not the case with this product. Of course it has the normal fragrance of nail polish but that is no surprise.  Overall I would highly recommend this product to anyone."
"No Title","2020-04-06","4","I love the product makes my nails look really great but the only thing is that if you do work a lot around the house it will start pealing off a little"
"No Title","2020-06-16","5","Holy grail of drug store nail products!  I was thrilled with the color saturation - white can be a tricky color!  Also it dries in a flash and I didn't need a base coat. THANK YOU for creating a nail polish that doesn't need a base coat!  So far 6 out of 5 stars from me!"
"No Title","2019-12-03","5","I've used their no light gel top coat and it's probably one of my favorites! It leaves your nails so nice and shiny and it dries pretty quickly too! I usually do 2 coats of top coat and it literally makes a simple color look like I got them done at a salon!"
"Best miracle gel nail polish.","2017-08-05","5","It looks awesome dries quickly and lasts for days. I applied two coats of the 1st step color then top coat of second step. All of them dried pretty quick. The color choices are lovely and the one I dried was shiny yet shuttle. I got lots of compliment for the color. Totally recommend it."
"I adore this set.","2022-06-02","5","I adore this set. It last forever it it actually runs dark enough to give me a real contour. Even the sculpting js dark enough to do a little something something for me. I use it most to suggest a different face structure for acting and cosplay. 10/10 would recommend"
"No Title","2018-11-09","4","I just can’t use this concealer - or any concealer for that matter. If you have any fine lines or wrinkles around your eyes this concealer will settle in there and accentuate those babies like it’s its business. On the plus side - it’s applicator is convenient but you do have to click the thing about 30 times before the first use. The formula is smooth and doesn’t have a strong smell and it does cover up any dark areas you might have. I would say, for the price, this is probably the best concealer on the market - that is why I gave it four stars: it does a great job concealing dark circles or spots, is super blendable, has added skin-loving ingredients, is affordable, and is easy to apply."
"No Title","2018-11-09","5","This is my favorite concealer. I’ve repurchased this concealer a minimum of 3 times. I wouldn’t say it’s high coverage like Tarte shape tape, however it does have a good medium coverage. The formula feels lightweight and rather hydrating underneath the eyes."
"Sally Hanson looking fancy!","2017-07-21","5","First off I love the brand Sally Hanson.  I have thin nails so this brand helps the most with keeping them strong and a little thicker!   I love this unique color.  I have never seen or used this color before and I think it is very unique and goes with so many colors of my clothes and has a diverse look of use from casual to fancy in my opinion!  My only complaint is that it would be nice if it was a nail polish that didn't require having to apply a top coat but had a top coat built in!"
"Awesome nail polish ,so happy I tried !","2017-10-25","5","This set of polish has made the process of application and overall visual appeal  ultra attractive and smooth . I love the results and am amazed by the particular color I received . It last for a very adequate amount of time and is ultimately fantastic !"
"Good but wrong color choice for me","2017-07-20","3","I liked the quality of the nail polish and a long lasting Ness of it but the birthday suit which is supposed to be a nude it was way too light on my toes but I am Hispanic so it could just be me. It looked a little too beige and I prefer something a little darker and closer to my skin tone. But I did love the nail polish and topcoat and will definitely try to get in a different color."
"No Title","2020-03-23","5","This nail polish is the highest quality I have ever used! I am loving the Sally Hansen Miracle Gel line and this is the second color I have tried. It applied smooth and shiny. The polish stayed on for a week without any chipping, but I think it could go even longer! The color is muted but still pretty. I think it is a great color for winter or"
"A great product they","2022-05-13","5","A great product they have a lot of things for women of color they need a wider selection of colors to choose from and it's kind of expensive for the quality of easy to remove but it doesn't have a color sudden thing it does come off on your clothing is very hard to remove"
"Hello girls, I'll tell you","2022-05-06","5","Hello girls, I'll tell you a little about buying this and I wasn't very sure but I was delighted this is great I swear you won't really regret it  this is super try it and come back to tell me how it went"
"No Title","2021-12-15","5","This brow pomade is amazing for people that are professionals as well as for people who are starting off trying to play with makeup. It holds the color all day and you can make your brows as natural or as dramatic as you'd like. I would recommend this pomade to everyone"
"No Title","2019-11-18","4","I love these pomades. They work really well and they don't fade so easily. I have used about 2 of these products already and they do last a good while. My only concern is they dry out really quickly , but overall I do recommend"
"Best & quickest brows","2022-09-05","5","I've used different brow products but I love how quick and easy this is to apply. I use the shade taupe with the abh brush. Sometimes I put the brow wiz to prep my brows. I've had this for years."
"No Title","2021-07-17","4","This is a decent nail polish. The formula lasts a few days to a week longer than what I'll call a ""regular"" drugstore nail polish. I think you're supposed to use a top coat but it does fine without one too. The colors are nice and pigmented. I would buy again."
"Dark circles be gone!","2016-05-31","4","I am Very sceptical of trying new concealer sand this one was no exception. However, it blew me away how well it covered my dark circles! I received this product free for testing purposes from influenster and I am so glad I did! Love this product!"
"Sally Hansen Miracle Gel Nailed it!","2017-10-31","5","Sally Hansen Miracle Gel have variety of amazing nail colors and finishes. I like the gliterry, copper color and glamorous look of Terra-Coppa, it goes well with my skin tone. I like the glossy, metalic copper finish. The Miracle Gel Top Coat also did the trick! It helps look more glossy and nail polish last longer. It didn't fade away yet and still looking great even after more than 2 weeks. Would definitely buy this product in the future! I would also recommend this product."
"LOVE!!!!!!!","2016-05-29","5","I've tried everything for the past 6 years to conceal my dark circles. Until I found this holy grail product. It completely conceals my dark circles. My face looks so much brighter now. I absolutely love this product. Its my go to concealer totally"
"This pallet is every","2022-03-31","5","This pallet is every makeup beginners dream. It comes with a highlighter, a bronzer as well as a contour. The bronzer and contour are super pigmented but very smooth on the skin. The highlighter is not overly blinding and very smooth on the skin it does not empasize texture.￼"
